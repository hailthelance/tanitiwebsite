               Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles, 
               the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, 
               and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000. 
               Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.

                    Transportation: Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. 
                    Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years. 
                    Ground Transportation: Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near
                    the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
